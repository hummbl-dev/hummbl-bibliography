@book{Gibson1979Ecological,
  title     = {The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception},
  author    = {Gibson, James J.},
  year      = {1979},
  publisher = {Houghton Mifflin},
  address   = {Boston, MA},
  isbn      = {978-0898599596},
  keywords  = {HUMMBL, Perception, P1-Observation, P4-ContextualAwareness, Affordances, EcologicalPsychology, DirectPerception},
  abstract  = {Gibson's foundational work revolutionizes perception theory by proposing that organisms directly perceive affordances in their environment without the need for cognitive mediation. This ecological approach shifts focus from information processing models to direct pickup of environmental information, emphasizing the relationship between organism and environment. The concept of affordances—action possibilities directly perceived in the environment—has influenced fields from psychology to HCI design. Gibson argues that perception is not about constructing internal representations but about detecting invariants in the ambient optic array that specify opportunities for action.}

@book{Marr1982Vision,
  title     = {Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information},
  author    = {Marr, David},
  year      = {1982},
  publisher = {W. H. Freeman},
  address   = {San Francisco, CA},
  isbn      = {978-0716712848},
  keywords  = {HUMMBL, Perception, P2-PatternRecognition, DE2-LevelSeparation, ComputationalVision, ThreeLevelAnalysis, Neuroscience},
  abstract  = {Marr establishes the computational theory of vision through a rigorous three-level framework: computational (what problem is being solved), algorithmic (how is it computed), and implementational (how is it physically realized). This decomposition provides a principled way to analyze complex perceptual systems and has become foundational in cognitive science and AI. Marr demonstrates how vision can be understood as information processing through stages: primal sketch, 2.5D sketch, and 3D model representation. His work bridges neurophysiology, psychology, and computer science, showing how perceptual problems have optimal computational solutions constrained by the structure of the visual world.}

@book{Schon1983Reflective,
  title     = {The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think in Action},
  author    = {Schön, Donald A.},
  year      = {1983},
  publisher = {Basic Books},
  address   = {New York, NY},
  isbn      = {978-0465068784},
  keywords  = {HUMMBL, Interpretation, IN1-SenseMaking, P5-Reflection, RE3-IterativeRefinement, ProfessionalKnowledge, ReflectionInAction, KnowingInAction, ProblemFraming},
  abstract  = {Schön challenges technical rationality as the sole basis for professional knowledge, introducing reflection-in-action and knowing-in-action as essential modes of professional competence. He demonstrates how practitioners frame problems, reframe situations during practice, and generate knowledge through reflective conversations with materials and contexts. This work bridges perception and interpretation, showing how professionals develop expertise through iterative cycles of action and reflection rather than mere application of theory. Schön's framework has influenced professional education across domains from architecture to medicine, emphasizing the artistry and interpretive judgment central to expert practice.}
