  abstract  = {This landmark study demonstrates that observers can fail to notice unexpected events when attention is otherwise engaged, even when those events are clearly visible. In the famous 'invisible gorilla' experiment, participants counting basketball passes often failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit walking through the scene. The findings reveal systematic limits of perception and challenge assumptions about conscious awareness. This work establishes that perception is not simply a function of what enters our visual field, but depends critically on attentional deployment. The results bridge perception and interpretation by showing how expectation and task focus shape what we consciously experience, with implications for eyewitness testimony, interface design, and understanding cognitive failures.}

  abstract  = {Gigerenzer and Goldstein challenge the view that cognitive heuristics are inherently flawed or second-best to optimal strategies. Instead, they demonstrate that simple, fast-and-frugal heuristics are often ecologically rational—adapted to the structure of the environment and the constraints of the cognitive system. The recognition heuristic and Take-The-Best algorithm are shown to outperform complex statistical models in real-world prediction tasks. This work reframes interpretation as adaptive rather than deficient, showing how satisficing strategies emerge from the co-evolution of mind and environment. The authors provide computational models validated against human performance, demonstrating that bounded rationality is not a limitation to overcome but an adaptive feature of intelligent systems operating under resource constraints.}
