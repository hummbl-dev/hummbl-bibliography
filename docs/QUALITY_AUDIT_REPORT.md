## Appendices

### Appendix A: Detailed DOI Lookup Strategy

**For High-Probability Candidates:**

1. **University Press Books** (Oxford, Chicago, Princeton, Cambridge)
   - Start at publisher catalog
   - Search by ISBN and title
   - Check book detail pages for DOI
   - Fallback: CrossRef API search

2. **Academic Journal Articles**

   - Search by author, year, title
   - DOI usually in article metadata
   - Fallback: Google Scholar → publisher link

3. **Trade Publishers** (Random House, HarperCollins, etc.)
   - Less consistent DOI assignment
   - Check publisher online catalog first
   - Try CrossRef API search
   - May require contacting publisher

**Tools:**
- https://search.crossref.org/ - Primary DOI search
- https://www.doi.org/ - DOI resolver for verification
