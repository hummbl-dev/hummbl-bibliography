### Design Principles

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Each agent has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
   - No agent duplicates another's core function
   - Handoffs occur at well-defined boundaries

2. **Explicit Communication**
   - All agent interactions use SITREP protocol
   - Success criteria defined before agent engagement
   - Results reported in standardized format

3. **Autonomous Execution**
   - Agents self-correct within their domain
   - Human intervenes only for cross-domain conflicts
   - Validation gates enable autonomous quality control

4. **Systematic Validation**
   - Every deliverable passes automated checks
   - Quality gates prevent defective handoffs
   - Zero-tolerance for technical debt accumulation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **SITREP Protocol**
   - Zero ambiguity in handoffs
   - Clear accountability for each agent
   - Measurable success tracking
   - Easy to debug when issues arose

2. **Cascade Autonomous Capability**
   - Self-corrected ES Modules issue without prompting
   - Proactively upgraded Node.js version
   - Maintained 100% validation throughout
   - Created professional git workflow

3. **Small Batch Strategy**
   - 5-target batches optimal for validation cycles
   - Fast feedback on approach effectiveness
   - Easy to course-correct between batches
   - Low risk per iteration

4. **Pre-Commit Automation**
   - Eliminated manual validation burden
   - Enforced quality at source
   - Enabled confident autonomous commits
   - Professional contributor experience

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Initial Context Transfer**
   - First batch had 3/5 missing entries (wrong assumptions)
   - **Fix:** Always do reconnaissance before strategy
   - **Lesson:** Don't assume repository contents

2. **Cross-Session Memory**
   - Some context lost between conversations
   - **Fix:** Systematic context documentation
   - **Lesson:** Master Context Index critical for continuity

3. **Agent Capability Discovery**
   - Didn't initially know Cascade could self-correct
   - **Fix:** Agent capability documentation upfront
   - **Lesson:** Test autonomous boundaries early

### Critical Success Factors

1. ✅ **Clear role separation** - No overlapping responsibilities
2. ✅ **Explicit communication** - SITREP protocol eliminated confusion
3. ✅ **Automated validation** - Quality gates caught issues immediately
4. ✅ **Small batches** - Fast feedback, low risk, easy course-correction
5. ✅ **Autonomous execution** - Cascade operated without micromanagement
