# HUMMBL Transformation Guide

This guide explains the six cognitive transformations in the HUMMBL framework and provides guidance for mapping bibliography entries to appropriate transformations.

## üéØ The Six Transformations

### P: Perspective

**Definition**: Observation, framing, lens-shifting, viewpoint changes

**Key Concepts**:
- Reframing problems from different angles
- Shifting between observer positions
- Recognizing frames and mental models
- Empathy and perspective-taking
- Context awareness and situational assessment

**Example Works**:
- Kahneman (2011): Dual-process perspective on thinking
- Norman (2013): User-centered design perspective
- Gibson (1979): Ecological perspective on perception
- Sch√∂n (1983): Reflective practice perspective

**Mapping Criteria**:
Assign **P** if the work:
- Explicitly discusses multiple viewpoints or frames
- Teaches methods for shifting perspective
- Analyzes how framing affects understanding
- Explores perception and observation processes

---

### IN: Inversion

**Definition**: Reversal, negation, contrapositive thinking, opposite approaches

**Key Concepts**:
- Thinking backwards from desired outcomes
- Exploring negative cases and failure modes
- Contrapositive reasoning (if not B, then not A)
- Paradoxical interventions
- Via negativa (defining by what something is not)

**Example Works**:
- Pearl (2009): Causal inversion and counterfactuals
- Taleb (2007): Inversion of predictability assumptions
- Wason (1968): Confirmation bias and hypothesis falsification
- Thaler (2008): Reverse psychology in choice architecture

**Mapping Criteria**:
Assign **IN** if the work:
- Uses reversal or negation as core method
- Explores opposite approaches to problems
- Discusses failure modes or negative cases
- Applies contrapositive reasoning

---

### CO: Composition

**Definition**: Building up, combining elements, synthesis from parts

**Key Concepts**:
- Assembling components into wholes
- Pattern composition and design patterns
- Building hierarchies and structures
- Combining strategies or heuristics
- Layering and scaffolding

**Example Works**:
- Alexander (1977): Pattern language composition
- Simon (1996): Composing artificial systems
- Gentner (1983): Structural mapping and analogy
- Miller (1956): Chunking and composition in memory

**Mapping Criteria**:
Assign **CO** if the work:
- Shows how to build complex from simple
- Discusses combination strategies
- Presents compositional frameworks
- Explores modular design and assembly

---

### DE: Decomposition

**Definition**: Breaking down, analysis into parts, chunking

**Key Concepts**:
- Analytical thinking and reduction
- Problem decomposition strategies
- Categorization and classification
- Modularization and separation of concerns
- Identifying components and relationships

**Example Works**:
- Simon (1955): Bounded rationality and satisficing
- Chi (1981): Expert categorization strategies
- Larkin (1980): Problem decomposition in expertise
- Gigerenzer (1996): Fast-and-frugal heuristic trees

**Mapping Criteria**:
Assign **DE** if the work:
- Emphasizes breaking down into parts
- Provides analytical frameworks
- Discusses categorization or classification
- Shows decomposition methodologies

---

### RE: Recursion

**Definition**: Self-reference, iterative processes, feedback loops

**Key Concepts**:
- Self-referential structures
- Feedback loops and cybernetics
- Iterative refinement
- Strange loops and tangled hierarchies
- Circular causality

**Example Works**:
- Hofstadter (1979): Self-reference and recursion
- Senge (1990): Feedback loops in systems
- Weick (1993): Recursive sensemaking
- Ries (2011): Build-measure-learn loops

**Mapping Criteria**:
Assign **RE** if the work:
- Explicitly discusses self-reference or recursion
- Emphasizes iterative processes
- Explores feedback mechanisms
- Deals with circular or cyclical patterns

---

### SY: Synthesis

**Definition**: Integration, holistic thinking, emergent properties

**Key Concepts**:
- Systems thinking and holism
- Emergent properties and complexity
- Integration across domains
- Gestalt and configuration
- Synthesis of multiple perspectives

**Example Works**:
- Meadows (2008): Systems synthesis
- Hutchins (1995): Distributed cognition synthesis
- Gladwell (2000): Network effects and tipping points
- Collins (2001): Integrative excellence frameworks

**Mapping Criteria**:
Assign **SY** if the work:
- Emphasizes holistic or systems thinking
- Discusses emergent properties
- Integrates multiple domains or perspectives
- Shows how parts create wholes greater than sum

---

## üîÑ Cross-Transformation Considerations

Many works span multiple transformations. Here's how to handle common combinations:

### CO + DE (Composition & Decomposition)
- Works on modular design
- Analysis-synthesis cycles
- Example: Miller (1956) on chunking

**Guideline**: Include both if work equally emphasizes building up AND breaking down.

### SY + RE (Synthesis & Recursion)
- Systems with feedback loops
- Emergent properties from iteration
- Example: Senge (1990), Meadows (2008)

**Guideline**: SY for holistic view, RE for cyclical processes.

### P + IN (Perspective & Inversion)
- Paradigm shifts
- Seeing from opposite viewpoints
- Example: Kuhn (1996), Kahneman (2011)

**Guideline**: P for framing changes, IN for reversal logic.

### All Six
- Comprehensive frameworks covering all aspects
- Rare: assign only most prominent 2-3

**Guideline**: Prioritize primary contribution over exhaustive tagging.

## üìä Mapping Decision Tree

Use this process to map entries:

```
1. Read abstract and introduction
   ‚Üì
2. Identify primary cognitive operation
   ‚Üì
3. Check against transformation definitions
   ‚Üì
4. Assign primary transformation (required)
   ‚Üì
5. Identify secondary operations (optional, max 2)
   ‚Üì
6. Verify with examples above
   ‚Üì
7. Add to BibTeX keywords
```

## ‚úÖ Mapping Best Practices

### Do:
- **Read carefully**: Base mapping on actual content, not just title
- **Be specific**: Choose transformations that work genuinely emphasizes
- **Limit tags**: 1-3 transformations maximum
- **Prioritize**: List primary transformation first in keywords
- **Provide rationale**: Explain mapping in PR or issue

### Don't:
- **Over-tag**: Avoid assigning all six transformations
- **Guess**: Don't map without reading or understanding content
- **Follow others blindly**: Each work should be evaluated independently
- **Ignore context**: Consider historical and disciplinary context

## üéì Transformation Interactions

Understanding how transformations relate:

```
P ‚Üê‚Üí IN    (Perspective ‚Üî Inversion)
- Seeing from opposite angles

CO ‚Üê‚Üí DE   (Composition ‚Üî Decomposition)
- Analysis-synthesis duality

RE ‚Üê‚Üí SY   (Recursion ‚Üî Synthesis)
- Iterative emergence

P ‚Üí SY     (Perspective ‚Üí Synthesis)
- Multiple views enable integration

DE ‚Üí CO    (Decomposition ‚Üí Composition)
- Understanding parts enables assembly

All ‚Üí SY   (All ‚Üí Synthesis)
- Synthesis often requires all others
```

## üìö Example Mappings

### Single Transformation

```bibtex
@book{Tufte2001VisualDisplay,
  keywords = {data visualization, information design, HUMMBL:P}
}
```
**Rationale**: Primarily about perspective and visual framing.

### Dual Transformation

```bibtex
@book{Pearl2009Causality,
  keywords = {causality, inference, causal models, HUMMBL:IN, HUMMBL:RE}
}
```
**Rationale**: Uses inversion (counterfactuals) and recursion (causal loops).

### Triple Transformation

```bibtex
@book{Meadows2008ThinkingSystems,
  keywords = {systems thinking, HUMMBL:SY, HUMMBL:RE, HUMMBL:CO}
}
```
**Rationale**: Synthesis (holistic systems), recursion (feedback), composition (system structure).

## üîç Edge Cases

### When work doesn't clearly fit?
- Choose closest match based on primary contribution
- Consult with maintainers via issue
- May be appropriate for multiple tiers

### When work fits all six?
- This is rare and often indicates over-tagging
- Choose 2-3 most prominent
- Focus on what work is known for

### When unsure between two?
- Consider the work's primary citation context
- What do others cite it for?
- When in doubt, choose fewer transformations

## üìù Template for Mapping Rationale

When proposing mappings, use this template:

```markdown
**Primary Transformation**: [XX]
**Rationale**: [Work] focuses on [key concept] which aligns with 
[transformation] because it [demonstrates specific behavior].

**Secondary Transformations**: [YY, ZZ]
**Rationale**: The work also addresses [concept] ([YY]) and 
[concept] ([ZZ]), but these are secondary to its main contribution.
```

## üéØ Quality Criteria

Good transformation mappings:
- ‚úÖ Based on careful reading
- ‚úÖ Justified with specific evidence
- ‚úÖ Limited to 1-3 transformations
- ‚úÖ Consistent with similar works
- ‚úÖ Useful for users seeking that transformation

Poor transformation mappings:
- ‚ùå Based only on title or keywords
- ‚ùå No clear rationale
- ‚ùå Too many transformations (4+)
- ‚ùå Inconsistent with work's actual content
- ‚ùå Overly broad or generic
