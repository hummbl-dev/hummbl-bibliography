A production-ready bibliography management system for the **HUMMBL (Base120) cognitive framework**. This repository maintains 48+ curated academic and practitioner works organized into 3 quality tiers, mapped to 6 cognitive transformations.

## üéØ Overview

The HUMMBL cognitive framework identifies six fundamental thinking operations:

- **P** (Perspective): Observation, framing, lens-shifting
- **IN** (Inversion): Reversal, negation, contrapositive thinking
- **CO** (Composition): Building up, combining elements
- **DE** (Decomposition): Breaking down, analysis into parts
- **RE** (Recursion): Self-reference, iterative processes, feedback loops
- **SY** (Synthesis): Integration, holistic thinking, emergent properties

This bibliography provides the theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for these transformations through carefully selected works spanning systems thinking, cognitive psychology, design, and organizational learning.

## üìö Bibliography Structure

### Three Quality Tiers

**T1: Canonical** (17 entries)

- Foundational theoretical works
- Seminal texts that define fields
- Examples: Meadows' *Thinking in Systems*, Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*

**T2: Empirical** (16 entries)

- Peer-reviewed research papers
- Rigorous experimental findings
- **Abstract Coverage: 100%** (all entries enhanced with 150-200 word summaries)
- Examples: Tversky & Kahneman on heuristics, Simon on bounded rationality

**T3: Applied** (15 entries)

- Practitioner-focused texts
- Industry applications
- Examples: Ries' *Lean Startup*, Brown's *Change by Design*

## üîÑ HUMMBL Transformation Mapping

Each bibliography entry is tagged with one or more HUMMBL transformations based on its primary cognitive contributions:

```bibtex
@book{Meadows2008ThinkingSystems,
  title = {Thinking in Systems: A Primer},
  author = {Meadows, Donella H.},
  year = {2008},
  publisher = {Chelsea Green Publishing},
  isbn = {978-1603580557},
  abstract = {...},
  keywords = {systems thinking, HUMMBL:SY, HUMMBL:RE, HUMMBL:CO}
}
```

For detailed guidance on mapping new entries, see [docs/TRANSFORMATION_GUIDE.md](docs/TRANSFORMATION_GUIDE.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Toolkit

The repository includes a comprehensive Node.js toolkit for bibliography management:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `validate.js` | Full validation with error/warning reports |
| `check-duplicates.js` | Cross-file duplicate detection |
| `fix-duplicates.js` | Automatic duplicate removal |
| `find-missing-dois.js` | DOI enrichment via CrossRef API |
| `stats.js` | Analytics dashboard with transformation coverage |
| `extract-keywords.js` | HUMMBL transformation keyword extraction |
| `merge-entries.js` | Interactive entry consolidation |

See [toolkit/README.md](toolkit/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new bibliography entry:

1. Check [docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md](docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md) for priority areas
2. Use the [new-entry issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-entry.md)
3. Follow [QUALITY_STANDARDS.md](docs/QUALITY_STANDARDS.md) for formatting
4. Map to appropriate HUMMBL transformations
5. Submit a pull request

All submissions are automatically validated via pre-commit hooks and CI/CD.

## üîç Gap Analysis

Current priorities for bibliography expansion:

- **Decomposition (DE)**: Need 4-6 additional entries
  - Analytical frameworks
  - Problem decomposition methodologies
  - Chunking and modularization

- **Inversion (IN)**: Need 3-5 additional entries
  - Negative space and contrapositive thinking
  - Failure mode analysis
  - Paradoxical interventions

See [docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md](docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md) for candidate works.

## ü§ñ Automation

### Pre-commit Hooks

Automatically runs validation on modified `.bib` files:

```bash
cd toolkit
npm run setup
```

### GitHub Actions

- **Validation**: Runs on every PR
- **Stats Report**: Generated weekly
- **DOI Enrichment**: Manual trigger for batch updates
