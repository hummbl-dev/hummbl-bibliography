## Coordination Methodology

### Communication Protocol: SITREP-Based Handoffs

**Structure:**
1. **Situation:** Current state assessment with metrics
2. **Tasks:** Clear success criteria and deliverables
3. **Execution:** Autonomous agent work with validation gates
4. **Report:** Structured output with results and next steps

**Benefits:**
- Clear boundaries between agent responsibilities
- Zero ambiguity in handoffs
- Measurable success criteria
- Systematic error detection and correction

### Multi-Agent Sprint Pattern

**Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Claude)**
- Analyze requirements and constraints
- Identify high-value targets
- Design validation gates
- Prepare agent-specific instructions

**Phase 2: Reconnaissance (Cursor)**
- Scan existing resources and gaps
- Identify structural patterns
- Prioritize candidates by feasibility
- Report findings with metrics

**Phase 3: Execution (Cascade)**
- Implement changes autonomously
- Self-correct technical issues
- Maintain quality gates
- Document work systematically
- Create production-ready deliverables

**Phase 4: Validation (All Agents)**
- Verify success criteria met
- Run automated validation
- Document lessons learned
- Prepare next iteration

### Coordination Level: 4.5 (Approaching Level 5)

**Level 4 Characteristics (Achieved):**
- ✅ Autonomous problem-solving within scope
- ✅ Self-correction without human intervention
- ✅ Clear communication via structured protocols
- ✅ Strategic alignment across all agents
- ✅ Production-quality deliverables

**Level 5 Requirements (In Progress):**
- ⏳ Full autonomous operation across sessions
- ⏳ Systematic trust tracking and verification
- ⏳ Cross-agent learning and optimization
- ⏳ Predictive coordination without explicit instruction

## Open Source Philosophy

### Multi-Agent Transparency

This project openly acknowledges AI agent contributions as a **methodological innovation** in scholarly infrastructure development. We believe that:

1. **AI agents are tools, not authors** - Human expertise guides, AI augments
2. **Transparency builds trust** - Open documentation of agent roles and contributions
3. **Quality over source** - Validation and peer review matter, not who wrote the code
4. **Reproducibility matters** - Documented protocols enable others to replicate methodology

### Attribution Model

**Human:** Provides vision, judgment, coordination, and final accountability  
**AI Agents:** Provide execution speed, systematic analysis, and technical precision  
**Result:** Higher quality, faster delivery, better documentation than either alone

This represents **augmented human capability**, not replacement.
