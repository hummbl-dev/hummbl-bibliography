  abstract = {This seminal paper introduces a three-level framework for understanding human performance in complex systems: skill-based, rule-based, and knowledge-based behavior. The skill-based level represents automatic, sensorimotor performance; the rule-based level involves the application of stored rules or procedures; and the knowledge-based level requires conscious problem-solving and decision-making. Rasmussen also distinguishes between signals (directly related to physical properties), signs (learned associations), and symbols (abstract representations) in human-machine interaction. The paper provides a comprehensive model for analyzing human error, suggesting that different types of errors occur at each level of cognitive control. This framework has become foundational in cognitive systems engineering, influencing the design of safer and more effective human-machine systems across domains from aviation to healthcare. The paper's insights continue to inform research on human factors, training design, and system safety.},

The authors examine how we understand others' minds through theory of mind, empathy, and mentalizing, highlighting the neural mechanisms underlying these processes. They discuss the role of mirror neurons, the temporoparietal junction, and the medial prefrontal cortex in social cognition. The paper also explores how social signals, such as gaze direction and facial expressions, are processed and integrated to form social judgments. The authors propose that social cognition is not just about understanding others but also about predicting and influencing their behavior. This work has significantly advanced our understanding of both typical social cognition and conditions where it is impaired, such as autism spectrum disorders. The integration of behavioral and neuroscientific approaches provides a robust framework for future research in social neuroscience.},

  abstract = {This landmark paper introduces three cognitive heuristics that people use to make judgments under uncertainty, along with the systematic biases that result from their application. The representativeness heuristic leads to judgments based on how similar an instance is to a prototype, often neglecting base rates and sample size. The availability heuristic causes people to estimate the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind, which can be influenced by recency, salience, and emotional impact. The anchoring and adjustment heuristic shows how initial values (anchors) bias subsequent numerical estimates, even when the anchors are arbitrary. The paper demonstrates through a series of experiments how these heuristics can lead to predictable errors in judgment and decision-making. This work laid the foundation for the field of behavioral economics and has had profound implications for understanding human reasoning, particularly in complex, uncertain environments. The research continues to influence diverse fields from medicine to public policy.},

Simon argues that decision-makers operate with incomplete information, limited cognitive resources, and time constraints, leading them to "satisfice" rather than optimize—choosing options that meet minimum criteria rather than seeking the single best outcome. The paper introduces the concept of "bounded rationality" to describe how actual human decision-making deviates from the idealized rational agent model. Simon's framework considers the decision environment's structure, the decision-maker's information-processing capabilities, and the cognitive costs of decision-making. This work has had profound implications across economics, psychology, and artificial intelligence, influencing fields as diverse as organizational behavior, behavioral economics, and human-computer interaction.

The paper also examines how factors like organizational slack, competition, and environmental turbulence influence the optimal balance. This work has had profound implications for research on organizational learning, innovation, and strategic management, providing a foundation for understanding the challenges of sustaining innovation in established organizations.

The analysis reveals how the firefighters' inability to abandon their existing mental models and tools (like their heavy equipment) when faced with an unprecedented firestorm led to tragic consequences. The paper introduces the concept of "cosmology episodes"—moments when people suddenly feel that their universe is no longer rational. This work has profoundly influenced organizational studies, crisis management, and high-reliability organization theory, offering critical insights into why organizations fail to adapt to unexpected events and how they can build more resilient sensemaking capabilities.},

Dunbar's research reveals that scientists primarily use analogical reasoning to understand unexpected findings, often drawing analogies to familiar biological systems or mechanical devices. The study identifies four key findings: (1) most reasoning is done in group settings rather than individually, (2) unexpected findings often lead to conceptual change rather than rejection of data, (3) analogies are frequently used to explain results to others, and (4) the social context of the laboratory significantly influences reasoning processes. The research challenges traditional models of scientific reasoning by demonstrating the importance of distributed cognition and collaborative problem-solving in scientific discovery.

The theory makes several key claims: (1) analogical processing is structure-mapping—a process of aligning and projecting knowledge from one domain to another based on shared relational structure; (2) the process is governed by the systematicity principle, favoring deep, interconnected systems of relations over superficial similarities; and (3) analogies can be distinguished from literal similarity statements and other types of comparisons based on the nature of the mapped relations. The paper presents empirical evidence from psychological experiments supporting these claims and introduces the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) as a computational model implementing these principles. This work has had profound implications for cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and education, providing a rigorous framework for understanding how analogical reasoning supports learning and problem-solving.},

Through mathematical analysis and computer simulations, the authors show that these simple heuristics can match or even outperform more complex decision strategies in real-world environments. The paper introduces the concept of ecological rationality—the idea that the effectiveness of a decision strategy depends on its match to environmental structures.

The study identifies several key differences: (1) experts spend more time developing qualitative representations of problems before attempting quantitative solutions, (2) they use principle-based approaches rather than formula-based approaches, and (3) they organize their knowledge around fundamental physical principles rather than surface features.
